# MyProjectShoppingApp QA 

## Why are we doing this? 

This is the my final project(Shopping API) of QA Software Development Bootcamp where we are implementing our learnings during the 10 weeks training.  The project require us to create a working Spring Boot API. With this, we will be able to test our understanding in the following:

* Agile & Project Management (Git, Jira)

* Databases & Cloud Fundamentals (H2, MySQL)

* Programming Fundamentals (Java)

* API Development (Spring Boot)

* Automated Testing (JUnit, Mockito)

* API Calls using Postman

> -	A functional application ‘back-end’, written in a suitable framework of the language covered in training (Java/Spring Boot)
> -	A build (.jar) of your application, including any dependencies it might need, produced using an integrated build tool (Maven).
> -	A series of API calls designed with postman, used for CRUD functionality. (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
