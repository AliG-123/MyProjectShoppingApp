# MyProjectShoppingApp QA 

## Why are we doing this? 

This is the my final project(Shopping API) of QA Software Development Bootcamp where we are implementing our learnings during the 10 weeks training.  The project require us to create a working Spring Boot API. With this, we will be able to test our understanding in the following:

* Agile & Project Management (Git, Jira)

* Databases & Cloud Fundamentals (H2, MySQL)

* Programming Fundamentals (Java)

* API Development (Spring Boot)

* Automated Testing (JUnit, Mockito)

* API Calls using Postman

## How I expected the challenge to go.

## What went well? / What didn't go as planned?

## Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
